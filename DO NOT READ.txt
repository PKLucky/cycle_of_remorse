=============================
Known issues:
* Windows Defender and other common anti-virus programs HATE LT-Maker games. Just choose to run the game anyway and/or make it an exception for Windows Defender. I promise I'm not trying to mess up your computer with my silly Fire Emblem fangame.

* The EXP gain SFX may sound weird on some computers. (The pitch is sound card dependent.) To adjust this, go into saves/config.ini. Change sound_buffer_size to a small even number until the SFX sounds right.

* Some water tiles are not animated.

* Most support conversations still need to be scripted.

* Controller button remapping is not implemented yet.

=============================

2) Open the saves folder.

=============================
Tips and Tricks:
* An in-game guide is available right from the Prologue and more entries are added throughout the game.

* You may change the screen size through: Extras > Options > Config > Screen Size
** The full-screen option is wonky and not recommended.

* You may toggle mouse controls through: Extras > Options > Config > Mouse

* If you run into a weird/game-breaking bug, first, please report it to PKLucky! Depending on what the bug is, it may be fixed by opening the debug menu by inputting the Konami Code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right) in the map menu (the one with the options Unit, Objective, Options, etc.). Feel free to ask PKLucky about the specific command(s) to fix your issue to continue your game.
